The nature of software
---

This project about the nature of software is directly inspired by the following works, which propose different perspectives on the invisibibility and omnipresence of software. 

The [systems engineering body of knowledge](swebok.org) identifies four core properties that make software different from other engineering artifacts. Invisibility is one of these properties, since software, understood as the mass of electromagnetic phenomena that emerge the software service, does not have a physical existence.
