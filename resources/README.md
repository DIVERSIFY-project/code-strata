Previous artistic work about software
---

> [CODeDOC @ Whitney artport](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/codedoc/index.shtml)

In 2002, the [Whitney Museum (USA)](http://whitney.org/) proposed the CODeDOC exhibition, commissioned by [Ars Electronica](http://www.aec.at/news/), for which all artists were assigned a specific task, which had to exploit the code as main material. The [work by Bradford Paley](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/codedoc/paley.shtml) is a very interesting example for our project. 

We have made a standalone version of this work, which is available [here](https://github.com/DIVERSIFY-project/CodeProfiles)
 
> [{Software} Structures @ Whitney](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/Artport/Commissions/SoftwareStructures)

In 2004, this exhibition at the [Whitney Museum (USA)](http://whitney.org/) explores the idea of software as art. In 2016, the project was revisited and most works were written in [Processing](https://processing.org/) were rewritten in [p5.js](http://p5js.org/).

The nature of software
---

This project about the nature of software is directly inspired by the following works, which propose different perspectives on the invisibibility and omnipresence of software. 

> [The nature of software in the SEBOK](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Software)

The [systems engineering body of knowledge](swebok.org) (SEBOK) identifies four core properties that make software different from other engineering artifacts. Invisibility is one of these properties, since software, understood as the mass of electromagnetic phenomena that emerge the software service, does not have a physical existence.

> [Software is eating the world](http://www.aberdeeninvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Why-Software-Is-Eating-The-World-8-20-111.pdf)

In this paper that appeared in the [Wall street journal](http://www.wsj.com/europe) in 2011, [Marc Andreesen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen), a pioneer in web devlopment, emphasizes the deep impact of software in all sectors of industry.

> [Software, the Invisible Technology](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/software-the-invisible-technology)

In 2016, this paper that appeared in [IEEE spectrum](http://spectrum.ieee.org/), comes back on Andreesen's vision five years later and discusses the deep impact of software, but also, almost paradoxically, the fact that software 'disappears' in the sense that it is not perceived as the source of value anymore.

Software vizualization
---

Here is a (short) list of tools to vizualize different aspects of software's structure and execution
- the [history of web browsers](http://visual.ly/browser-history)
- the [evolution of the web](http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/)
- [http://findtheflow.io/](http://findtheflow.io/)
- and [other examples](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/06/50-great-examples-of-data-visualization/)
