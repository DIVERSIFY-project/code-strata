        <p>Musicologists and software scientists collaborate to reveal the beautiful and complex code strata that
            underlie
            software applications.</p>
        <p>Software is, by nature, invisible, yet it is omnipresent in our lives. This pervasiveness of software is
            the result
            of organic and decentralized processes. A growing number of companies and individuals have contributed to
            the
            development and aggregation of millions of software pieces. The assembly and coordination between all these
            pieces
            relies on a flexible hierarchical organization of software and a stratfied organization of the code.</p>
        <p>This interdisciplinary project, aims at building visual and sound devices that reveal these code strata to
            an
            audience as large as possible. Stratigraphy reveals the beauties of geological or ecological structures.
            Inspired by
            these natural wonders of structure and complexity, we want to restore a more tangible relation between
            users and the
            software world through artistic representations.</p>
        <p>We choose to focus on the strata of <span id="code">ctrl-c ctrl-v</span>, an iconic action that symbolizes
            the major
            impact of software on all sectors of our societies. We deconstruct all the code that has been stacked to
            provide
            this action in almost any software tool. We choose an open source text editor to pursue this deconstruction
            of code
            strata. The choice of open source code is essential for us since it provides an access to all strata, but
            also to
            the origin of these strata.</p>
