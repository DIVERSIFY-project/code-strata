		<p>Musicologists and software scientists collaborate to reveal the beautiful and complex code strata that underlie
			software applications.<br />
			Software is, by nature, invisible, yet it is omnipresent in our lives. This pervasiveness of software is the result
			of organic and decentralized processes. A growing number of companies and individuals have contributed to the
			development and aggregation of millions of software pieces. The assembly and coordination between all these pieces
			relies on a flexible hierarchical organization of software and a stratfied organization of the code.<br />
			This interdisciplinary project, aims at building visual and sound devices that reveal these code strata to an
			audience as large as possible. Stratigraphy reveals the beauties of geological or ecological structures. Inspired by
			these natural wonders of structure and complexity, we want to restore a more tangible relation between users and the
			software world through artistic representations.<br />
			We choose to focus on the strata of <span id="code">ctrl-c ctrl-v</span>, an iconic action that symbolizes the major
			impact of software on all sectors of our societies. We deconstruct all the code that has been stacked to provide
			this action in almost any software tool. We choose an open source text editor to pursue this deconstruction of code
			strata. The choice of open source code is essential for us since it provides an access to all strata, but also to
			the origin of these strata.</p>
